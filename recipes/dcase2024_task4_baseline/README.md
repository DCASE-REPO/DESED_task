## <a id="reach_us">Any Question/Problem ? Reach us !</a>

For any problem consider raising a GitHub issue here. <br>
We have also a [DCASE Slack Workspace][slack-invite], join the `task-4-2024` channel there or contact the organizers via Slack directly.<br>
We also have a [Troubleshooting page](./HELP.md).

## Installation

The script `conda_create_environment.sh` is available to create an environment which runs the
following code (recommended to run line by line in case of problems). 

## Downloading the Task Datasets

You can download all the training and development datasets using the script: `generate_dcase_task4_2024.py`.

### Usage:
Run the command `python generate_dcase_task4_2024.py --basedir="../../data"` to download the dataset. <br> 
‚ö†Ô∏è the user can change basedir to the desired data folder. If you do so remember then to change the corresponding entries in `confs/pretrained.yaml"`

If the user already has downloaded parts of the dataset, it does not need to re-download the whole set. It is possible to download only part of the full dataset, if needed, using the options:

 - **only_strong** (download only the strong labels of the DESED dataset)
 - **only_real** (download the weak labels, unlabeled and validation data of the DESED dataset)
 - **only_synth** (download only the synthetic part of the dataset)
 - **only_maestro** (download only MAESTRO dataset)

For example, if the user already has downloaded the real and synthetic part of the set, it can integrate the dataset with the strong labels of the DESED dataset with the following command:

```bash
python generate_dcase_task4_2024.py --only_strong
```

## Baseline System

We provide one baseline system for the task which uses pre-trained BEATS embeddings and Audioset strong-annotated data together with 
DESED and MAESTRO data. <br>

This baseline is built upon the 2023 pre-trained embedding baseline. 
It exploits the pre-trained model [BEATs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09058), the current state-of-the-art on the [Audioset classification task](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/audio-classification-on-audioset). In addition it uses by default the Audioset strong-annotated data. <br>
<br>
üÜï We made some changes in the loss computation as well as in the attention pooling to make sure that the baseline can handle 
now multiple datasets with potentially missing information.

In the proposed baseline, the frame-level embeddings are used in a late-fusion fashion with the existing CRNN baseline classifier. The temporal resolution of the frame-level embeddings is matched to that of the CNN output using Adaptative Average Pooling. We then feed their frame-level concatenation to the RNN + MLP classifier. See `desed_tasl/nnet/CRNN.py` for details. 

See the configuration file: `./confs/pretrained.yaml`:

```yaml
pretrained:
  pretrained:
  model: beats
  e2e: False
  freezed: True
  extracted_embeddings_dir: ./embeddings
net:
  use_embeddings: True
  embedding_size: 768
  embedding_type: frame
  aggregation_type: pool1d
```

The embeddings can be integrated using several aggregation methods : **frame** (method from 2022 year : taking the last state of an RNN fed with the embeddings sequence), **interpolate** (nearest-neighbour interpolation to adapt the temporal resolution) and **pool1d** (adaptative average pooling as described before).

We provide [pretrained checkpoints][zenodo_pretrained_models]. The baseline can be tested on the development set of the dataset using the following command:
`python train_pretrained.py --test_from_checkpoint /path/to/downloaded.ckpt`

To reproduce our results, you first need to pre-compute the embeddings using the following command:
```bash
python extract_embeddings.py --output_dir ./embeddings"
```
You can use an alternative output directory for the embeddings but then you need to change the corresponding path in 
`confs/pretrained.yaml`.

Then, you can train the baseline using the following command:
```bash
python train_pretrained.py
```
The default directory for checkpoints and logging can be changed using `--log_dir="./exp/2024_baseline` and will use GPU 0.  
You can however pass the argument `--gpu` to change the GPU used. <br>
‚ö†Ô∏è note that `python train_pretrained.py --gpus 0` will use the CPU. 
GPU indexes start from 1 in this script ! <br>

Tensorboard logs can be visualized using the command `tensorboard --logdir="path/to/exp_folder"`. <br>
Training can be resumed using the following command:

```bash
python train_pretrained.py --resume_from_checkpoint /path/to/file.ckpt
```

In order to make a "fast" run, which could be useful for development and debugging, you can use the following command: 

```bash
python train_pretrained.py --fast_dev_run
```

‚ö† all baselines scripts assume that your data is in `../../data` folder in `DESED_task` directory.
If your data is in another folder, you will have to change the paths of your data in the corresponding `data` keys in YAML configuration file in `conf/sed.yaml`.
Note that `train_pretrained.py` will create (at its very first run) additional folders with resampled data (from 44kHz to 16kHz)
so the user need to have write permissions on the folder where your data are saved.

üß™ Hyperparameters can be changed in the YAML file (e.g. lower or higher batch size). <br>
A different configuration YAML (for example `sed_2.yaml`) can be used in each run using `--conf_file="confs/sed_2.yaml` argument. <br>


## (New !) üß™üß™ Baseline System Hyper-Parameter Tuning via Optuna

We provide an [Optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) based script for hyper-parameters tuning. 
You can launch the hyper-parameter tuning script using: 

```bash
python optuna_pretrained.py --log_dir MY_TUNING_EXP --n_jobs X  
```
where MY_TUNING_EXP is your output folder which will contain all the runs for the tuning experiment (Optuna supports resuming the experiment which is pretty neat). <br>
You can look at `MY_TUNING_EXP/optuna-sed.log` to see the full log for the hyperparameter tuning experiment and which is the best run with the best 
configuration up to now. <br>

‚ö†Ô∏è n_jobs should be set equal to the GPUs you have set with `export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. <br>
Note that if the GPUs are not in **exclusive compute mode** (nvidia-smi -c 2) the script will launch all the jobs on the first GPU only !!  


The script tunes first all the parameters except the median filter lengths. <br>
To tune this latter, take the best configuration as found in the previous tuning and then launch this one, which only tuned the 
median filter lengths on the dev-test set. 
```bash
python optuna_pretrained.py --log_dir MY_TUNING_EXP_4_MEDIAN --n_jobs X  --test_from_checkpoint best_checkpoint.ckpt --confs path/to/best.yaml
```

### Baseline Novelties Short Description

The baseline is the same as the pre-trained embedding [DCASE 2023 Task 4 baseline](https://github.com/DCASE-REPO/DESED_task/tree/master/recipes/dcase2024_task4_baseline), based on a Mean-Teacher model [1]. <br>
We made some changes here in order to handle both DESED and MAESTRO which can have partially missing labels (e.g. DESED events may not be annotated in MAESTRO and vice-versa). <br> 
In detail: 

1. We map certain classes in MAESTRO to some DESED classes (but not vice-versa) when training on MAESTRO data.
   1. See `local/classes_dict.py` and the function `process_tsvs` used in `train_pretrained.py`.
2. When computing losses on MAESTRO and DESED we mask the output logits which corresponds to classes for which we do miss annotation for the current dataset.
   1. This masking is also applied to the attention pooling layer see `desed_task/nnet/CRNN.py`. 
3. Mixup is performed only within the same dataset (e.g. only within MAESTRO and DESED). 
4. To handle MAESTRO, which is long form, we perform overlap add at the logit level over sliding windows, see `local/sed_trained_pretrained.py`
5. We use a per-class median filter
6. We extensively re-tuned the hyper-parameters using Optuna.

## Short Datasets Description

A more accurate description of the datasets used is available in [official DCASE Challenge website page][dcase_webpage]. <br>
This year we use two datasets which have different annotation procedures: 
1. [DESED](https://github.com/turpaultn/DESED) (as in previous years)
   1. This dataset contains both synthetic strong annotated, strongly labeled (from Audioset), weakly labeled and totally unlabeled audio clips of 10 s. 
2. [MAESTRO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.14572.pdf)
   1. this dataset contains soft-labeled strong annotations as obtained from crowdsourced annotators in various acoustic environments.
      1. Note that the onset and offset information was obtained from aggregating multiple annotators opinions over different 10 second windows with 1 s stride.
      2. Also, compared to DESED, this dataset is long form as audio clips are several minutes long. 

Crucially these datasets have sound event classes that are partially shared (e.g. _Speech_ and _people_talking_), as well as some that are not shared. <br> 
In general, since annotation is different, we do not know if some events that are not shared do or do not occur, hence the need to handle the "missing information". 
Participants are challenged on how to explore how these two datasets can be combined in the best way during training, in order to get the best performance on both. <br>
We already described how we handle such missing information in the baseline regarding loss computation, mixup and the attention 
pooling layer. 

‚ö† domain identification is prohibited. The system must not leverage domain information in inference whether the audio comes 
from MAESTRO or DESED. 

## Evaluation Metrics

### üëâ Multi-runs Evaluation
Further we kindly ask participants to provide (post-processed and unprocessed) output scores from three independent model trainings with different initialization to be able to evaluate the model performance's standard deviation.


### ‚ö° Energy Consumption (mandatory this year !)

Since last year, energy consumption (kWh) is going to be considered as additional metric to rank the submitted systems, therefore it is mandatory to report the energy consumption of the submitted models [11]. 

Participants need to provide, for each submitted system (or at least the best one), the following energy consumption figures in kWh using [CodeCarbon](https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon):

1) whole system training
2) devtest inference

You can refer to [Codecarbon](https://github.com/mlco2/codecarbon) on how to accomplish this (it's super simple! üòâ). 

#### Important Steps

1. **Initialize the Tracker**:
   - When initializing the tracker, make sure to specify the GPU IDs that you want to track.
   - You can do this by using the following parameter: `gpu_ids=[torch.cuda.current_device()]`.

2. **Example**:
   ```python
   from codecarbon import OfflineEmissionsTracker
   tracker = OfflineEmissionsTracker(gpu_ids=[torch.cuda.current_device()], country_iso_code="CAN")
   tracker.start()
   # Your code here
   tracker.stop()

3. **Additional Resources**:
   - For more hints on how we do this on the baseline system, check out `local/sed_trainer_pretrained.py`.

‚ö†Ô∏è In addition to this, we kindly suggest the participants to
provide the energy consumption in kWh (using the same hardware used for 2) and 3)) of:

1) training the baseline system for 10 epochs
2) devtest inference for the baseline system

Both are computed by the `python train_pretrained.py` command. You just need to set 10 epochs in the `confs/default.yaml`. <br> 
You can find the energy consumed in kWh in `./exp/2024_baseline/version_X/codecarbon/emissions_baseline_training.csv` for training and `./exp/2024_baseline/version_X/codecarbon/emissions_baseline_test.csv` for devtest inference. 

Energy consumption depends on hardware, and each participant uses different hardware. To account for this difference, we use the baseline training and inference kWh energy consumption as a common reference. It is important that the inference energy consumption figures for both submitted systems and baseline are computed on the same hardware under similar loading.

### (NEW) This year, we ask participants submit the whole .csv files that provide the details of consumption for GPU, CPU and RAM usage. For more information, please refer to the submission package example.



### üßÆ Multiply‚Äìaccumulate (MAC) operations. 

Starting from last year, counting the MAC is complementary to the energy consumption metric. We consider the Multiply‚Äìaccumulate operations (MACs) for 10 seconds of audio prediction to provide information about the computational complexity of the network in terms of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations.

We use [THOP: PyTorch-OpCounter][THOP: PyTorch-OpCounter] as the framework to compute the number of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs). <br>
For more information regarding how to install and use THOP, the reader is referred to https://github.com/Lyken17/pytorch-OpCounter. <br>


## [sed_scores_eval][sed_scores_eval] based PSDS evaluation

Recently, [10] has shown that the PSD-ROC [9] may be significantly underestimated if computed from a limited set of thresholds as done with [psds_eval][psds_eval].
This year we therefore use [sed_scores_eval][sed_scores_eval] for evaluation which computes the PSDS accurately from sound event detection scores.
Hence, we require participants to submit timestamped scores rather than detected events.
See [https://github.com/fgnt/sed_scores_eval](https://github.com/fgnt/sed_scores_eval) for details.
